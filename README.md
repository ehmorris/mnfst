Proof of concept: never sign in, instead sign text.

A Twitter-like app that uses PGP keys. API only for now.

_Create a new status_. This takes JSON where the content is a piece of
text that is signed using a PGP key.

    POST /statuses
    Content-Type: application/json

    { status: { signed_body: PGP-signed-ASCII } }

    =>

    201

_View updates_. This shows all statuses for the people who have signed
your PGP key. Produces a JSON result.

    GET /followers/:keyid/statuses
    Content-Type: application/json


    =>

    200
    { keyid: KEYID,
      page: 1,
      per_page: 50,
      signers_statuses: [
        { keyid: KEYID1, signed_body: PGP-signed-ASCII1, created_at: DATE },
        { keyid: KEYID2, signed_body: PGP-signed-ASCII2, created_at: DATE },
        { keyid: KEYID1, signed_body: PGP-signed-ASCII3, created_at: DATE },
        { keyid: KEYID3, signed_body: PGP-signed-ASCII4, created_at: DATE }
    ] }

_View a status_. Takes a status ID. This is mostly here just for sharing
URLs with others.

    GET /statuses/:id
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json

or:

    GET /statuses/:id
    Content-Type: text/html
